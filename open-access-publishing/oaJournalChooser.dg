<* How to choose an open access journal
 *
 * Current open questions:
 *   - Should the preprints part be in a separate chart? Is it a
 *     recommendation or could it be compulsory?
 *   - Contact Think.Check.Submit about using their check?
 *   - Does FORCE11 have a recommendation for licensing (CC BY
 *     preferred? Ask authors to think of a good reason not to use CC BY?)
 *   - Still struggling with adding comment boxes to terminate: reject
 *     doesn't look right!
