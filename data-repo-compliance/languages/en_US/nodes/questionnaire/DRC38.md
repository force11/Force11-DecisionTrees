Does the PID resolve to a landing page that describes the data?

Both the [FAIR principles](https://www.dtls.nl/fair-data/fair-principles-explained/) and the [Data citation principles](https://www.force11.org/group/joint-declaration-data-citation-principles-final) require that metadata persist, even if the data they describe are no longer available.  FAIR also requires that the access rights to the data be both machine-readable and human understandable.  Having the persistent identifier resolve to this page rather than to the data themselves ensures that a stable reference is provided even if the data are removed.  The descriptive metadata should also include the necessary information for citing the data set (see  Fenner M, Crosas M, Grethe J, Kennedy D, Hermjakob H, Rocca-Serra P, Berjon R, Karcher S, Martone M, Clark T (2016) A Data Citation Roadmap for Scholarly Data Repositories. bioRXiv Dec. 28, 2016.
